to create the ssh on 42school machine and probably on others

1. ssh-keygen

then add it to agent (maybe first skip this on 42 machines cause they could already have it)

2. eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
you'll see agent pis 12345

3. ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

then to change remote url from https to ssh

to see it before changing use

4. git remote -v 

you'll see 
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push) 

then use to change the remote:
you have to change username and change the repository
5.git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git

for example
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:pnshad/core.git

then verify
6. git remote -v

it should look something like this:
origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git (push)

mine was 
origin	git@github.com:pnshad/core.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:pnshad/core.git (push)

tada!
