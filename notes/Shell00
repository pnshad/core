EX07 

* to restore the file b (wich is the modified file) from file ‘a’
And the sw.diff file 
... patch a sw.diff -o b 
By using the -o we ask the modification to be written to a file called b (rather than done to a )

To check the b file 
I can check their b with diff with my b 

I also can use their b and do the {diff a b > sw.diff2}
And then diff sw.diff sw.diff2

EX08

To only search for files -type f 
To add multiple criteria we put them in \( here \)
To delete -delete 
To print -print 
find . -type f \( -name '*~' -or -name '#*#' \) -delete -print
