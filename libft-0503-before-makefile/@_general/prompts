this code meant to be a replication of c library's strnstri(), please review this code and offer suggestion for improvements and corrections. keep in mind that, unless it's impossible or very impractical I want to use pointers in my code.

this is the function: (after that you'll find the main)

#include "libft.h"

char    *ft_strnstr(const char *big, const char *little, size_t len)
{
        char    *ptrbig;

        ptrbig = (char *)big;
        if (*little)
                return (ptrbig);
        while (*big &&  len > 0)
        {
                while (*ptrbig == *little && *little)
                {
                        ptrbig++;
                        little++;
                }
                if (*little)
                        return(ptrbig);
                big++;
                ptrbig++;
                len--;
        }
        return (NULL);
}

int main(void)
{
        char *big1 = "in this sentence I want you to try to find this beautiful word, isn't it beautiful";
        char *little1 = "beautiful";
        char *little2 = "";
        char *little3 = "technical";
        char *little4 = "\0";
        char *little5 = "this";

        printf("%s is the output of big1 & beautiful\n",ft_strnstr(big1, little1, strlen(big1)));
        printf("%s is the output of big1 & \"\"\n",ft_strnstr(big1, little2, strlen(big1)));
        printf("%s is the output of big1 & technical\n",ft_strnstr(big1, little3, strlen(big1)));
        printf("%s is the output of big1 & \\0\n",ft_strnstr(big1, little4, strlen(big1)));
        printf("%s is the output of big1 & this\n",ft_strnstr(big1, little5, strlen(big1)));
        return (0);

}
